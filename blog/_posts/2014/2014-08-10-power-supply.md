Again through [Kijiji](http://www.kijiji.ca) (ok - I work for Kijiji, so I have to check for stuff there first, don't I?),
I obtained a nice Alinco DM-330 power supply. It is a switching one, but got [good reviews on eHam](http://www.eham.net/reviews/detail/765) and I like 
the various extra front panel outputs, which not only makes it usable for my rig but also to power up various experiments. The Yaesu is happy
with it, so I'm happy.
