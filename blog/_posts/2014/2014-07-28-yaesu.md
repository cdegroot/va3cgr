On [Kijiji](http://www.kijiji.ca), I found a decently priced Yaesu FT-897 (with the stable oscillator and bolt-on antenna tuner options). It's not a perfect rig, but gives me pretty much all bands and will work at home, in the car, and outdoors. Even though I eventually want to go into soldering my own, mostly SDR-based, kit, I think this will serve me well in the near future. 

Next, a power supply (easy) and convincing my wife that we need 20 meters of wire running through the backyard (hard).
