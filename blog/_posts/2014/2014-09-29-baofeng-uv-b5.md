A while ago, just so I had an HT, I ordered (through eBay):

- a [Baofeng UV-B5](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/221285045386) Dual-Band VHF/UHF HT (C$32.34 including shipping)
- a [USB Programming Cable](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/380895046076) (C$4.71 including shipping)
- a [Telescoping Antenna](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/301121057121) labeled as a Nagoya 711 (C$11.14)

For a grand total of C$48.19. I love China - if you have patience, they'll send you anything and call you a friend for life :-)

The verdict so far: it seems to be a solid little device, [Chirp](http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home) has no
problems programming it, so I think it's a steal. 

Also, I picked up a 75W inverter at a gas station meaning I can charge the little thing in my car and thus always have
emergency VHF/UHF available.
